      "Recently, data analytics has become very popular and frequently used in any business. Businesses today around the world have some portion of their operations being automated, which concurrently has meant that a lot of data about these processes is being collected (from sensors or internal company data etc). A combination of AI, big data analytics, and data science techniques seems to be a growing trend in many industry sectors, with predictive analytics being one of the most well-known. Vast numbers of software platforms are available for data extraction, scrubbing, analysis, and visualization. Some of these platforms are specialized for carrying out one of the above-listed aspects of data analytics, while others offer a generalist tool to carry out almost all tasks ranging from data scrubbing to visualization. This course gives an overview of different data analytic mechanisms and also provides a brief knowledge of various data analytics tools. After the competition of this course, participants can apply the data analytics model in real-life problem solving.\n",

      "Recently, data analytics has become very popular and frequently used in any business. Businesses today around the world have some portion of their operations being automated, which concurrently has meant that a lot of data about these processes is being collected (from sensors or internal company data etc). A combination of AI, big data analytics, and data science techniques seems to be a growing trend in many industry sectors, with predictive analytics being one of the most well-known. Vast numbers of software platforms are available for data extraction, scrubbing, analysis, and visualization. Some of these platforms are specialized for carrying out one of the above-listed aspects of data analytics, while others offer a generalist tool to carry out almost all tasks ranging from data scrubbing to visualization. This course gives an overview of different data analytic mechanisms and also provides a brief knowledge of various data analytics tools. After the competition of this course, participants can apply the data analytics model in real-life problem solving.\n",
