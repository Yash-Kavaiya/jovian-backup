    "- Download the CSV manually and upload it via Jupyter's GUI\n",
    "- Use the `urlretrieve` function from the `urllib.request` to download CSV files from a raw URL\n",

    "## Inferences and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the survey respondents' demographics, we can infer that the survey is somewhat representative of the overall programming community. However, it has fewer responses from programmers in non-English-speaking countries and women & non-binary genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The programming community is not as diverse as it can be. Although things are improving, we should make more efforts to support & encourage underrepresented communities, whether in terms of age, country, race, gender, or otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although most programmers hold a college degree, a reasonably large percentage did not have computer science as their college major. Hence, a computer science degree isn't compulsory for learning to code or building a career in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A significant percentage of programmers either work part-time or as freelancers, which can be a great way to break into the field, especially when you're just getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Javascript & HTML/CSS are the most used programming languages in 2020, closely followed by SQL & Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is the language most people are interested in learning - since it is an easy-to-learn general-purpose programming language well suited for various domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust and TypeScript are the most \"loved\" languages in 2020, both of which have small but fast-growing communities. Python is a close third, despite already being a widely used language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmers worldwide seem to be working for around 40 hours a week on average, with slight variations by country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can learn and start programming professionally at any age. You're likely to have a long and fulfilling career if you also enjoy programming as a hobby.\n"

    "- Pick a different set of columns (we chose 20 out of 65) to analyze other facets of the data\n",
    "- Prepare an analysis focusing on diversity - and identify areas where underrepresented communities are at par with the majority (e.g., education) and where they aren't (e.g., salaries)\n",
